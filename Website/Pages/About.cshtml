<h1>About Dino-Diner</h1>

<p>
    Founded in 2019 from the collective collective consciousness of the Fall Semester 
    CIS 400 students of Kansas State University, Dino-Diner is devoted to bringing you 
    the finest in dinosaur-themed dining experiences. Despite the prehistoric nature of 
    our menu, we only use the freshest of ingredients, and no dinosaurs were harmed to 
    bring our delectable fare to you.
